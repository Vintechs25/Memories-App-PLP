## Project Overview  
This project, titled **"Memories"**, was developed as part of my learning journey at **PLP Africa Academy**. It is a full stack social media application built using the **MERN Stack**: **MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js**.

The aim of the app is to allow users to create and share memorable moments or life events. Users can post stories, edit or delete them, and interact with the content, simulating a basic social media experience.

## Learning Objectives  
Through this project, I aimed to:

- Gain practical experience with the MERN stack
- Understand RESTful API design using Express.js
- Learn CRUD operations with MongoDB
- Build responsive front-end interfaces using React
- Implement full stack integration between front-end and back-end

## Technologies Used  
- **Front-end:** React.js  
- **Back-end:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **State Management:** Redux  
- **Styling:** Material-UI

## Setup Instructions  
To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate into both the `/client` and `/server` directories and install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start both the client and server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
4. Make sure MongoDB is running locally or configured via a cloud provider like MongoDB Atlas.

## Project Demo  
The interface is intuitive and responsive. Below is a screenshot of the working application:
